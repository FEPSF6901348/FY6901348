        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
            Time Crystals are a part of condensed matter physics. Time Crystals are a quantum system of particles 
            whose lowest energy state is one in which particles are in repetitive motion. The system cannot lose 
            energy to the environment and come to rest because it is already in its quantum ground state. Time 
            Crystals are a relatively new and exotic phase of matter that was proposed by Nobel laureate Frank 
            Wilczek in 2012 <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="time-translation-symmetry">1.1 Time Translation Symmetry</h2>
        <p>
            Time translation symmetry (also known as temporal translation symmetry). It is a fundamental concept in 
            physics and maths. It refers to the invariance of physical laws and phenomena over time. In other words, 
            if a physical system exhibits time translation symmetry, it means that the laws governing that system 
            remain unchanged as time progresses.
        </p>

        <h3 id="conservation-of-energy">1.1.1 Conservation of Energy</h3>
        <p>
            Time translation symmetry is closely related to the conservation of energy. If the laws of physics do not 
            change over time, it implies that the total energy of a closed physical system remains constant over time. 
            This principle is known as the conservation of energy.
        </p>

        <h3 id="mathematical-formulation">1.1.2 Mathematical Formulation and Broken Symmetry</h3>
        <p>
            Mathematically, time translation symmetry is often expressed using the concept of time derivatives. If 
            the laws of physics are invariant under time translations, it means that the equations describing the 
            system's behaviour remain the same when time is shifted by a constant value.
        </p>

        <h2 id="quantum-computing">1.2 Quantum Computing</h2>
        <p>
            Quantum computers represent a completely new approach to computing. By using principles of quantum 
            physics, they can solve very complex statistical problems that normal computers can't. Quantum Computing 
            is built on quantum bits, or qubits, which can store zeros <span class="italic">and</span> ones 
            simultaneously. This is known as superposition <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="time-crystals-in-qc">1.2.1 Time Crystals in Quantum Computing</h3>
        <p>
            Google's Quantum Computing team made headlines in 2019 when they performed the first-ever computation 
            that ordinary computers weren't thought to be able to do in a practical amount of time. The time crystal 
            demo marks one of the first times a Quantum Computer has found gainful employment <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="recipe-of-time-crystals">1.3 'Recipe' of Time Crystals</h2>
        <p>
            A Time Crystal is a newly realised phase of matter in which particles move in a regular, repeating cycle 
            without burning any energy. The phase arises through a combination of three special ingredients: 
            <span class="bold">Many-Body Localisation</span>, <span class="bold">Eigenstate Order</span>, and a 
            <span class="bold">Periodic Driver</span>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">1.4 Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Our effort to realize a time crystalline phase uses quantum processors in a unique way. The challenge is 
            extrapolating the response to infinite time and system size, which is rooted in the finite coherence time 
            of the system. The core of our work is to devise experimental methods to provide a basis for such 
            extrapolations <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>.
