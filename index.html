    <h3>Time Crystals</h3>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>
        Time Crystals are a part of condensed matter physics. Time Crystals are a quantum system of particles whose 
        lowest energy state is one in which particles are in repetitive motion. The system cannot lose energy to the 
        environment and come to rest because it is already in its quantum ground state. Time Crystals are relatively 
        new and exotic phase of matter that was proposed by Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek in 2012 
        <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1.1 Time Translation Symmetry</h2>
    <p>
        Time translation symmetry (also known as temporal translation symmetry). It is a fundamental concept in 
        physics and maths. It refers to the invariance of physical laws and phenomena over time. In other words, if a 
        physical system exhibits time translation symmetry, it means that the laws governing that system remain 
        unchanged as time progresses.
    </p>

    <h3>1.1.1 Conservation of Energy</h3>
    <p>
        Time translation symmetry is closely related to the conservation of energy. If the laws of physics do not 
        change over time, it implies that the total energy of a closed physical system remains constant over time. 
        This principle is known as the conservation of energy. When physicists derive conservation of energy in a 
        system, they start by considering time translation symmetry. By analysing the equations of motion, they can 
        show that the total energy remains constant because the equations for kinetic and potential energy do not 
        change with time.
    </p>

    <h3>1.1.2 Mathematical Formulation and Broken Symmetry</h3>
    <p>
        Mathematically, time translation symmetry is often expressed using the concept of time derivatives. If the 
        laws of physics are invariant under time translations, it means that the equations describing the system's 
        behaviour remain the same when time is shifted by a constant value. If you have a physical system described 
        by equations and you have the variable t (time) with t + change in t where change in t is constant.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many physical systems exhibit TTS (time translation symmetry). For instance: Laws of motion in classical 
        mechanics, Quantum Mechanics using Schrödinger's equation. Broken Symmetry is when TTS can be broken, for 
        example in the presence of external forces or non-conservative processes, the total energy of a system may 
        not remain constant. This would lead to a violation of TTS.
    </p>

    <h2>1.2 Quantum Computing</h2>
    <p>
        Quantum computers represent a completely new approach to computing. By using principles of quantum physics, 
        they are able to solve very complex statistical problems that normal computers can't. Quantum Computing is 
        built on quantum bits, or qubits, which can store zeros <span class="italic">and</span> ones. Qubits can 
        represent any combination of both zero and one simultaneously. This is known as superposition 
        <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2.1 Time Crystals in Quantum Computing</h3>
    <p>
        Google's Quantum Computing team made headlines in 2019 when they performed the first-ever computation that 
        ordinary computers weren't thought to be able to do in a practical amount of time. The time crystal demo marks 
        one of the first times a Quantum Computer has found gainful employment. Google's qubits consist of 
        superconducting aluminium strips. Each has two possible energy states, which can be programmed to represent 
        spins pointing up or down. For the demo collaborators used a chip with 20 qubits to serve as the time crystal 
        <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1.3 'Recipe' of Time Crystals</h2>
    <p>
        A Time Crystal is a newly realised phase of matter in which particles move in a regular, repeating cycle 
        without burning any energy. The phase arises through a combination of three special ingredients.
    </p>
    <p>
        A row of particles, each with a magnetic orientation, or 'spin', will ordinarily settle into an arrangement 
        with the lowest possible energy but random interference can make the particles get stuck in a higher-energy 
        configuration. The effect is called <span class="bold">Many-Body Localisation</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many-body localised systems can exhibit a special kind of order: if you flip all the spins in the system you 
        get another Many-body localised state. This is known as the <span class="bold">Eigenstate Order</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, the last 'ingredient' needed is known as a <span class="bold">Periodic Driver</span>. If you drive 
        the system with a laser, it will forever cycle (flip) between the states without absorbing any net energy from 
        the laser. This has now formed a Time Crystal.
    </p>

    <h2>1.4 Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Our effort to realize a time crystalline phase uses quantum processors in a unique way. That’s because 
        computations are usually carried out on these processors with a set of logical operations called quantum 
        gates. The computation has no relation to the underlying governing dynamics of the system – in technical 
        terms, the desired Hamiltonian is not realized on the processor. In such computations, the processor is used 
        in roughly the same way as in a classical computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, this quest of establishing a dynamical phase is fundamentally different. Here, the question is 
        whether a stable phase can emerge in a many-body driven isolated system. For such questions, our processor and 
        our setting is indeed the natural platform to explore such questions. Our implementation is on the direct path 
        toward realization of this dynamical phase. The challenge that makes our result fall short of a full 
        realization is extrapolating the response to infinite time and system size, which are all ultimately rooted in 
        the finite coherence time of the system. The core of our work and achievements is to devise experimental 
        methods to provide a basis for making such extrapolations.
    </p>
    <p>
        As our results show, the protocols developed here are general and establish a scalable approach to studying 
        non-equilibrium phases of matter on NISQ processors
